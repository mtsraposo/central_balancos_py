To set up Google API authentication, 
follow this [guide](https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby/blob/master/doc/authorization.md```).

Contrary to what the guide recommends, in the `Create Credentials` step, 
select `Web Application` instead of `Other`, as it's no longer available.   

The `webdrivers` gem will take care of updating `chromedriver` to the version of
Chrome that you are using.
