# Central Balan√ßos

## How to run
- run the binary file (e.g. central_balancos_m1_mac) - choose the one corresponding to your OS:
```zsh
dist/central_balancos_m1_mac
```
- it normally takes 10-20 seconds for the application to start up, because of the way it is bundled.

## How to bundle
If none of the binaries match your OS, bundle the project again, by running:
```zsh
chmod +x bundle.sh && bundle.sh 
```
